<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
The program starts by prompting the user to enter a URL to scan for vulnerabilities. It checks for SQL injection by appending test payloads to the URL and looking for error messages in the responses. It then scans for XSS vulnerabilities by submitting test payloads in forms found on the webpage and checking if the payloads are reflected in the responses. Finally, it generates a report of found vulnerabilities and suggests mitigation strategies to address them.
